# 🩺 Diabetes Prediction – Kaggle Playground Series

## 📌 Competition
Diabetes Prediction Challenge from the Kaggle Tabular Playground Series.

## 🎯 Objective
Predict the probability that a patient is diagnosed with diabetes using demographic and health-related features.

---

## 📊 Dataset
Synthetic healthcare dataset with features such as:

- Age
- BMI
- Gender
- Education Level
- Smoking Status
- Income Level

Target variable: **diagnosed_diabetes**

> Dataset not included due to Kaggle competition rules.

## ⚙️ ML Pipeline

This project follows a modular machine learning structure similar to real-world ML systems.

### Steps:
1. Data preprocessing (missing values, datatype handling)
2. Feature engineering (categorical encoding)
3. Model training using XGBoost
4. Train-validation split for performance evaluation
5. Prediction on competition test dataset
6. Submission file generation
